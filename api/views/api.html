        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: rgb(26, 25, 25); padding: 1em;">The User Transparency Act (UTA) is a act to showcase trust and honesty with all the bots users and servers. The UTA tells users what data is being stored/collected, from user data to server data. Any/all stored data will never be released/sold/or given. As of now the bot owner is the only person that has access to that data, in the future only highly trusted/very limited admins will have access to that data. Here is what we collect;
            <br>
            - This bot only collects data that is sent to it, under the prefix W<br>
            - Data such as guild(server) IDs, server name's user IDs, user name's and message contents may also be collected to ensure stability and collect response time.<br>
            - Collected data may be manually reviewed for the purpose of identifying ToS violations, when requested by the user.<br>
            - Crash logs are collected and they tell us what server it crashed in, member who crashed it and command used to crash it. If abuse is found there will be a punishment, review [ToS](link)<br>
            - Anonymized aggregate data may also be published in the form of generalized statistics. Collected data will never directly be publicly released.<br>
            - All data is automatically removed and permanently deleted when you remove/kick/ban the bot from your server or delete your server.

        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: rgb(26, 25, 25); padding: 1em;">Witchery is a Divination tool and Informational bot;<br>
            Abuse of the bot, as outlined below, is not tolerated.<br>
            
            By using the bot, you accept these terms.<br>
            <br>
            <i><b>Abuse</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Abuse of the bot's features. This includes:<br>
            - spamming (repeated and/or rapid use of the bot)<br>
            - destructiveness (crashing/ breaking and/or slowing the bot down)<br>
            - automated interaction with the bot (selfbotting)<br>
            - using the bot to disrupt normal behavior in a server.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i><b>Punishments</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            If the bot is found to be abused by a specific user, whether it be by manual (admin intervention) or automatic intervention, the user will receive a strike, up to a total of 10 strikes.
            What is a ban? -  A banned user wont be able to use the bot or  add it to servers. A banned server means the bot will ban its self and the bot will no longer be able to re join 
            Upon these specific strike intervals, the user will be either temporarily or permanently banned:
            <br>
            3 strikes: One day (24 hour) ban from user and or server<br>
            7 strikes: One week (7 day) ban from user and or server<br>
            10 strikes: Permanent ban from user and or server<br>
            Upon being banned, users may join the support server and request themselves or a server being unbanned. An unban request will void the privacy policy temporarily, and allow an admin to review all your interactions with the bot for a qualitative analysis of the interactions that resulted in the ban. The admin will remove strikes and bans accordingly. Admins also have the right to kick/ban a bot from a server/user at any point without any strikes.<br>
