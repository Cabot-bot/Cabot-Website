    These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.<br/>
When we say “Cabot,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Cabot-bot., its subsidiaries, and its related companies.<br/>
When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Cabot’s services, apps, websites, and other products.<br/>
When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.<br/>
We also have a <a href="/privacy"> Privacy Policy</a>, that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services. If you use our API, Cabot’s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use.<br/>
Together, these rules make Cabot possible, and they matter to us.

    We’re actively developing new features and products to improve Cabot. As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering old services. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. We are not liable for any such outages or service changes. We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at https://cabot-bot.xyz/, or notify you by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
